# AutoClicker
Needed an AutoClicker with random delay, so decided to code my own.

Still a work in progress, one day i'll make the executable available.
So just build this badboy and do it yourself meanwhile.

### Current available functions

* AutoClicks pointer location with random delay
* Delay is 0 to (N) MS


### Todo

* Click on given pointer location
* Click on multiple locations
* Get keybind for start/stop
